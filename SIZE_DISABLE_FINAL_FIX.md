# ✅ Size Selection Fixed for Lanyard and Tela Categories

## 🔧 **Issue Identified and Fixed:**

### **Root Cause:**
The size disabling logic wasn't working because the categories "Lanyard" and "Tela" didn't exist in the database. The database only had sample categories like "Uniforms", "School Supplies", etc.

### **Solution Applied:**

1. **Added Missing Categories to Database:**
   - Added "Lanyard" and "Tela" categories to the database
   - Categories are now available in the admin forms

2. **Verified Size Disabling Logic:**
   - The `isSizeDisabled()` function correctly converts category names to lowercase
   - Compares against 'lanyard' and 'tela' (case-insensitive)
   - Works with both uppercase ('LANYARD', 'TELA') and lowercase ('lanyard', 'tela') category names

## 🎯 **Current Implementation:**

### **Add Product Form** (`/admin/products/add-product/add-product-form.js`)
```javascript
const isSizeDisabled = () => {
  if (!categoryId) return false;
  const selectedCategory = categories.find(c => c.id === Number(categoryId));
  if (!selectedCategory) return false;
  
  const categoryName = selectedCategory.name.toLowerCase();
  return categoryName === 'lanyard' || categoryName === 'tela';
};
```

### **Edit Product Form** (`/admin/products/edit/[id]/page.js`)
- Same logic implemented for consistency

## 🚀 **Expected Behavior:**

1. **Select "Lanyard" or "Tela" category:**
   - Size section becomes grayed out and disabled
   - Shows message: "Sizes are not available for this category"
   - Add Size button disappears (in add form)
   - Form submission excludes size data

2. **Select any other category:**
   - Size section works normally
   - All size controls are available
   - Form submission includes size data

## 📋 **Database Status:**
- ✅ "Lanyard" category added to database
- ✅ "Tela" category added to database
- ✅ Categories are available in admin forms

## 🎨 **Visual Changes:**
- Size section becomes `opacity-50 pointer-events-none` when disabled
- Clear visual feedback with informative messages
- Consistent behavior across add and edit forms

**The size selection is now properly disabled for Lanyard and Tela categories!** 🎯✨

## 🔍 **Testing Instructions:**
1. Go to Admin → Products → Add Product
2. Select "Lanyard" or "Tela" from the category dropdown
3. Verify that the size section becomes disabled
4. Select any other category and verify sizes work normally
5. Test the same behavior in the Edit Product form
